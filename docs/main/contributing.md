## Contributing to the project 

We welcome contributions to the project.  We're not quite set up so you can just fork the project, pick an issue and send us a pull request so in the first instance please contact [Mike Smith](@mrdrsmith).

Once that's done or if you just want to poke around then you'll need to follow these steps:

- Clone the repo
- Install the NuGet command line.  We use [chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) to do this but your options are all [here](http://docs.nuget.org/consume/Command-Line-Reference).
- Open a PowerShell window, and navigate to the local project directory.  Restore the packages using the following command ![nuget restore](./images/restorePackages.jpg)
- For the time being we use this to generate the documentation.

### Now you can do other things.
