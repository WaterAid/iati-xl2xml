If InRange' is a single cell, the last cell of the entire worksheet if found. If' InRange contains two or more cells, the last cell in that range is' returned.' If SearchOrder is xlByRows (= 1), the last cell is the last' (right-most) non-blank cell on the last row of data in the' worksheet's UsedRange. If SearchOrder is xlByColumns' (= 2), the last cell is the last (bottom-most) non-blank cell in the' last (right-most) column of the worksheet's UsedRange. If SearchOrder' is xlByColumns + xlByRows (= 3), the last cell is the intersection of' the last row and the last column. Note that this cell may not contain' any value.' If SearchOrder is anything other than xlByRows, xlByColumns, or' xlByRows+xlByColumns, an error 5 is raised.'' ProhibitEmptyFormula indicates how to handle the case in which the' last cell is a formula that evaluates to an empty string. If this setting' is omitted for False, the last cell is allowed to be a formula that' evaluates to an empty string. If this setting is True, the last cell' must be either a static value or a formula that evaluates to a non-empty' string. The default is False, allowing the last cell to be a formula' that evaluates to an empty string.'''''''''''''''''''''''''' Example:'       a   b   c'               d   e'       f   g'' If SearchOrder is xlByRows, the last cell is 'g'. If SearchOrder is' xlByColumns, the last cell is 'e'. If SearchOrder is xlByRows+xlByColumns,' the last cell is the intersection of the row containing 'g' and the column' containing 'e'. This cell has no value in this example.''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''Dim WS As WorksheetDim R As RangeDim LastCell As RangeDim LastR As RangeDim LastC As RangeDim SearchRange As RangeDim LookIn As XlFindLookInDim RR As RangeSet WS = InRange.WorksheetIf ProhibitEmptyFormula = False Then    LookIn = xlFormulasElse    LookIn = xlValuesEnd IfSelect Case SearchOrder    Case XlSearchOrder.xlByColumns, XlSearchOrder.xlByRows, _            XlSearchOrder.xlByColumns + XlSearchOrder.xlByRows        ' OK    Case Else        Err.Raise 5        Exit FunctionEnd SelectWith WS    If InRange.Cells.Count = 1 Then        Set RR = .UsedRange    Else       Set RR = InRange    End If    Set R = RR(RR.Cells.Count)        If SearchOrder = xlByColumns Then        Set LastCell = RR.Find(What:="*", After:=R, LookIn:=LookIn, _                LookAt:=xlPart, SearchOrder:=xlByColumns, _                SearchDirection:=xlPrevious, MatchCase:=False)    ElseIf SearchOrder = xlByRows Then        Set LastCell = RR.Find(What:="*", After:=R, LookIn:=LookIn, _                LookAt:=xlPart, SearchOrder:=xlByRows, _                SearchDirection:=xlPrevious, MatchCase:=False)    ElseIf SearchOrder = xlByColumns + xlByRows Then        Set LastC = RR.Find(What:="*", After:=R, LookIn:=LookIn, _                LookAt:=xlPart, SearchOrder:=xlByColumns, _                SearchDirection:=xlPrevious, MatchCase:=False)        Set LastR = RR.Find(What:="*", After:=R, LookIn:=LookIn, _                LookAt:=xlPart, SearchOrder:=xlByRows, _                SearchDirection:=xlPrevious, MatchCase:=False)        Set LastCell = Application.Intersect(LastR.EntireRow, LastC.EntireColumn)    Else        Err.Raise 5        Exit Function    End IfEnd WithSet GetLastCell = LastCellEnd Function
